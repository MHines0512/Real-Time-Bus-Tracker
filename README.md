# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

This exercise makes use of bus data as well as display markers to show the daily bus stops that take place between Harvard and MIT.  

How to Run: Save all files to the same folder and open index.html file in new window.

Future Improvements: I may choose to revisit this exercise to add more detail with more markers or simiply show another route or different data.
